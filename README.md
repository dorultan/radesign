# About this project.

Radesign is a responsive and mobile-friendly single page web application developed for one of my clients. Among the other clients, it is the only project I have successfully finished. It is created using the technologies shown below and used nested carousels (horizontal and vertical) to create the landing page using the free package Swiper. This web app also has a dashboard from where the client can manage the content which is stored in a mongoDB storage on mlab and used aws s3 to store images.
